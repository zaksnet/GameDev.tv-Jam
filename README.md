TODO:
- Improve/Organize/Cleanup the code.
- Add more weapons like grenades, bazooka, mines, AK!
- Add more animations/tiles.
- Add more levels.
- Make it a full game?

Prioritie is to make a full game as fast as possible for now. For that reason, the code might not be the best example. Once thats done we will do some refactoring and polishing.
