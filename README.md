If this gets enough stars (5 to start with) we could:

- Improve/Organize/Cleanup the code.
- Add more weapons like grenades, bazooka, mines, AK!
- Add more animations/tiles.
- Add more levels.
- Make it a full game?
- Make it modular. This means that we could create a weapon system for example that can be taken and used in any project by just copy pasting the files.
